Work in a group of two to refactor the code that you submitted for Assignment 1.

Here are your tasks:

1- Get the code of your assignment 1 submission.

2- Add 'undo' feature to one of your classes - i.e. a user can revert back an object to an older state.

3- Refactor the code to incorporate the following design patterns:

A) Dependency Injection (this can be with or without Google Guice),

B) Observer,

C) Domain Specific Language,

D) Facade.

Note:

- In your project, add code comments to highlight where the design patterns are implemented.
